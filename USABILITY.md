# Some things to think about...

- Why does Hack exist? Why were you not happy with other typefaces?
- Hack can't be a solution for everyone. Whose or which solution is it? Define the environment (as a flexible persona) who is the target user.
- How is that defined in terms of usability, and in terms of identity?
- When is Hack a success?
- How do we approach usability issues, but also the existing usability. Usability is often a result of decisions, and these decisions should ideally be based on a sort of "usability-guideline".
